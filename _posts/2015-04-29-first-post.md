This post is just experimentation. I humbly appologize to anyone who actually reads it.

### Introductions Are In Order

For starters, I am not new to blogging. I have quit blogging many times in the past. This is perhaps my 3rd or 4th attempt. Consider this like a revival of a revival of a revival.

### Whatcha bloggin bout?

Well, my plan for this blog is to talk about Web Development (are you supposed to capitalize that?). Specifically, I plan to blog about how to properly use **Angular** with **ASP.NET Web API** and **Entity Framework**. I've spent many years now working primarily in C#, mostly building Web Services, and LOB apps. But lately (along with the rest of the developer world) I've been bitten by the JavaScript bug. So a lot of this territory is going to be new to me. Therefore, you should always take what I say with a grain of salt. But like a really, really delicious grain of salt!

### Disclaimer

I tend to have a lot of opinions. And I like to smear those opinions all over the place. Fortunately, my opinions are usually right. So whilst being messy and bothersome to those whose faces I am smearing them on, those people most often walk away with a face full of enlightenment. Luck them right?! Yeah... you're welcome.


### P.S.

There are a few other topics I may end up blogging about. Things like Git, Jekyll, Cmder, LINQPad, Slurpees, and stupid stuff Chad said. So, lace up your shoes, pull on your hats, and prepare yourself for some nerdguments!
